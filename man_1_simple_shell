.SH DESCRIPTION
This program simulates a command interpreter based in Unix and GNU/LINUX with its most basic commands.
Through a terminal emulator and some executable instructions (shell scripts), the user can interact with this \fBsimple_shell.\fR
This simple shell program is not supposed to be an exact imitation of the original Unix Shell.
This doesn't cover all of the instructions the original does.

.B Invocation
To start the interactive mode the program will be executed, then starts the mode indicated by '$', to exit the mode type 'exit' or 'ctrl + d'. In the non-interactive mode, the location that contains the command to be executed must be specified in the command line.

.B Execution
The program takes the arguments of the command line in a string and it is tokenizes into words using "space" as a delimiter, the first word is consider the command and all remaining are considered the arguments to that command. If the command is valid:

1. If the first argument is different to '.', '/' or shell builtin, the program searches in the PATH and then invocates it.
2. If the first character is '.' or '/', the program executes that typed command with the passed argument.
